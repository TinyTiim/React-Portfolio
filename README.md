  ## Description

  I made this Portfolio using backend and React, as well as node_modules. This project showed me how fun it is to use React as opposed to just plain html and css. I still have alot more I want to be able to do with this portfolio and add alot more animations. Features I would love to implent are light and dark mode, and finshing the contact page and skills.
